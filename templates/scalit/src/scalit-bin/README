Scalit - Bringing literate programming to Scala
===============================================
Maintained by Sebastian Gfeller, published under
the Scala license.

Installation:
- If you have downloaded the binary distribution:
  copy the file scalit.jar to $SCALA_HOME/lib, the
  lib folder where you installed Scala. Afterwards,
  you should be able from every directory to type

  scala weave.Weave

  and get an empty LaTeX document as output.
  Afterwards,
  you'll have to place scaladefs.sty somewhere where
  your TeX distribution can find it.

- If you have downloaded the source distribution:
  First, type

  ./bootstrap.sh

  This will compile the sources with the jar that was
  included and then compile them again with the binaries
  built before. If you have noweb installed, you can also
  bootstrap without the jar:

  ./bootstrap.sh notangle

  If that process has completed, type

  make

  This will build the documentation.

  Finally, you can install the program by typing

  sudo make install SCALA_HOME=$SCALA_HOME

  If for some reasons, this does not work, you can type

  make jar

  And install the jar like in the binary distribution.
